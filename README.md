# Vector Implementation in C++

---

## Task Description

This task involves implementing vector operations using C++. The provided files are as follows:

- `da.h` contains the function signatures that need to be implemented.
- `da.cpp` is where the function definitions will be implemented.
- `main.cpp` is a file used for testing the application.
- `catch.hpp` and `test.cpp` are used for testing. **Do not modify them**. Any modifications to these files will result in submission failure.

## Instructions

1. **Read the Comments**: Carefully go through the comments in the code files, especially in `da.h` and `da.cpp`, to understand what each function is expected to do.

2. **Implementation**: Fill in the missing lines in `da.cpp` to implement the functions defined in `da.h`.

3. **Testing**: Before submission, make sure to run the tests using the following commands in the command line or Terminal:

   ```bash
   make clean
   make test
